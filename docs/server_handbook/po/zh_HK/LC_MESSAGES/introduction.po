"Welcome to SysAdm™! This documentation is intended to educate the user on "
"initializing and configuring the SysAdm™ remote management options. "

":ref:`gettingstarted`, and :ref:`management`."

#: ../../introduction.rst:33
msgid ""
"SysAdm™ is a middleware utility designed to streamline system management "
"with options for both local and remote access."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:36
msgid ""
"By default, SysAdm™ does **not** allow for remote access. The user must "
"configure the system to allow this feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:39
msgid ""
"One unique element to SysAdm™ is how the middleware is designed to modify "
"the system directly. SysAdm™ has no middleware database, which means all "
"changes made with SysAdm™ modify the system configuration files directly, "
"resulting in a system administrator no longer needing to log into a system "
"via SSH or relearn system management. SysAdm™ \"speaks\" the same language, "
"allowing for simple and effective system administration."

#: ../../introduction.rst:47
msgid ""
"For remote access, SysAdm™ is being designed to route encrypted traffic "
"through a \"bridge\", a static announcement server which facilitates "
"communication between the user's controlling device and the remote access "
"system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../introduction.rst:52
msgid ""
"In order to address security concerns, the bridge device is always "
"considered \"untrusted\" and several layers of encryption are added to all "
"traffic flowing through the bridge to ensure it can not be used to record or"
" alter critical information flow."
