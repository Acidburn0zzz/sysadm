.. Intro Text WIP. Needed is a full description of what sysadm is and what it can do. SysAdm is a middleware utility designed to provide a user access to firewalled servers and systems from any location with an open access point to the internet. To accomplish this goal, a bridge device has been created, which relays all traffic between the firewalled system and the user's controlling device. In order to address security concerns, the bridge device is always considered "untrusted" and several layers of encryption are added to all traffic flowing through the bridge to ensure the bridge can not be used to record or alter critical information flow. Once a secure connection has been established, a user can fully control a firewalled system or group of systems through the SysAdm utility. Installing packages, creating work tasks, running build servers and automation; controlling a secure system from any Internet connected location with minimal risk of a security breach is the ultimate goal of SysAdm. 

Welcome to SysAdm™! This documentation is intended to educate the user on initializing and managing the SysAdm™ middleware.
Initialization and management will be documented in two separate chapters, :ref:`gettingstarted`, and :ref:`management`.
API documentation is being handled at https://api.pcbsd.org.
